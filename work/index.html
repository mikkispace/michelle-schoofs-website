                  <h3>Jubilee Austin Project</h3>
                  <p>The Jubilee Austin Project is a mock website that I created as part of a Skillcrush course. I received some of the code and an image of how the final product should look. I filled in the missing code and used a Photoshop Comp to create the website you see here.</p>

                  <h3>The Rogue Pickings Project</h3>
                    <p>The Rogue Pickings Project is a mock portfolio website that I created as part of a Skillcrush course. I received a Photoshop Comp and had to develop it from there to make the web site look like the comp.  I used PS to pull the image and measurements, then worked the code from there.</p>

                  <h3>The Holstee Manifesto Challenge</h3>
                  <p>I was given the challenge to create my version of the Holstee Manifesto. I decided to develop it as a full page document using some of my photography and a video of music by the band, Apocalyptica that fit the message within the manifesto.</p>
