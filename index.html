                <h3>Jubilee Austin Project</h3>
                <p>The Jubilee Austin Project is a mock website that I created as part of a Skillcrush course. I received some of the code and an image of how the final product should look. I filled in the missing code and used a Photoshop Comp to create the website you see here.</p>

                <h3>The Rogue Pickings Project</h3>
                  <p>The Rogue Pickings Project is a mock portfolio website that I created as part of a Skillcrush course. I received a Photoshop Comp and had to develop it from there to make the web site look like the comp.  I used PS to pull the image and measurements, then worked the code from there.</p>

                <h3>The Holstee Manifesto Challenge</h3>
                <p>I was given the challenge to create my version of the Holstee Manifesto. I decided to develop it as a full page document using some of my photography and a video of music by the band, Apocalyptica that fit the message within the manifesto.</p>

                <p>I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with my family and furbabies. I started my career in banking and recently found myself looking for a new direction. Through some research and review of the job market, I found myself at a crossroads. I could continue moving down the same path or discover something new and different. Different can be an exciting prospect, and that lead me down the path of web development where I quickly fell in love with tech.</p><br>

                <p>I've been involved in artistic endeavors my whole life, and the creative aspect of pulling a website together and making it come to life is fascinating. Once I started, I wanted to learn more. Upon building my first website, I found something that gave me a new view of the world that I had only been a spectator in prior.  I have made the career switch to front-end web development and using organizational, problem resolution and detail oriented skills to write clean and elegant code. </p>
